First Last Sequence
Given a number n, the first last sequence is defined as follows. The first row contains numbers 1 to n. The last row contains numbers n+1 to 2n The second row contains numbers 2n+1 to 3n The second last row contains numbers 3n+1 to 4n .... We end the sequence when we reach n^2, For example - for 3, the first last sequence is - 1,2,3 7,8,9 4,5,6 (notice how first row is 1-3, last is 4-6, second is 7-9, and we stop there because 9 = 3*3, and number of rows = n. We add a row to the top, then to bottom, then to top, and then stop). Let's see how it looks for an even number. For 4, the first last sequence is - 1,2,3,4 9,10,11,12 13,14,15,16 5,6,7,8 (notice that the number of rows = n in this case also. We add a row to top, then to bottom, then to top, then to bottom, and then stop because we reach n^2 ). Given a number n, we need to print the first-last sequence for that number.
Constraints:
1<=T<=10 where T is the number of test cases. 
1<=n<=500 where n is the individual test case for which we are generating the first-last sequence.
Input Format:
The first line contains the number of test cases T. 
The next T lines contain each individual test case n.
Output Format:
The first last sequence for each input. Ensure the output ends with a \n character.
